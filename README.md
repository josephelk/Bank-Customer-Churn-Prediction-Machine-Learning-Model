- Train a binary classification model. Perform EDA and try to understand the data, preprocess the data, train, evaluate the model and analyze the results!

- Perform fine-tuning using GridSearchCV, explain the results 

- Explain what is the ROC curve and what does it tell us about a classification model's performance 

- One taboo in ML is fitting scalers and encoders to the whole dataset. Why?
